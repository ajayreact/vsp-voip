# Getting Started with Telnyx Voice API

> Complete step-by-step guide to get started with Telnyx Voice API, from account creation to making your first call.

Welcome to the Telnyx Voice API! This guide will walk you through everything you need to start building voice applications with Telnyx, from creating your account to making your first API call.

## What You'll Build

In this guide, you'll set up a complete voice application that can make outbound calls and be ready to explore advanced features like AI assistants, speech recognition, and media streaming.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* A computer with internet access.
* Basic understanding of REST APIs and webhooks.
* A development environment with your preferred programming language (we'll provide examples in multiple languages).
* (Optional) A tool like [ngrok](/development/development-tools/ngrok-setup/index#ngrok) for local webhook testing.

## Create Your Telnyx Account

To get started with the Voice API, you'll need a Telnyx account. Follow our [account creation guide](/docs/account-setup/create-account) to set up your account and access the Mission Control Portal.

## Obtain Your API Key

To authenticate your Voice API requests, you'll need an API key. Follow our [API key creation guide](/development/api-fundamentals/create-api-keys) to generate and securely store your API key.

## Set Up Your Webhook URL

To receive real-time events from the Voice API, you'll need to set up webhooks. Follow our [webhook fundamentals guide](/development/api-fundamentals/webhooks/receiving-webhooks) to configure your webhook URL and create a handler for Voice API events.

## Buy a Phone Number

To make calls with the Voice API, you'll need a phone number. Follow our [phone number purchase guide](/docs/numbers/phone-numbers/buy-phone-number) to buy a number that will be associated with your Voice API application.

## Create a Voice API Application

A Voice API Application defines how Telnyx handles calls to and from your numbers.

### Creating Your Application

1. In the Mission Control Portal, navigate to **Real-Time Communication** > **Voice** > **Programmable Voice**.
2. Click on the **Create Voice App** button in **Voice API Applications** tab.

#### cURL

```bash theme={null}
curl --location 'https://api.telnyx.com/v2/calls' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your_api_key' \
--data '{
   "to": "+1234567890",
   "from": "your_phone_number",
   "connection_id": "your_connection_id",
   "command_id": "unique-command-id-123"
}'
```

#### Node.js

```javascript theme={null}
const axios = require('axios');

const makeCall = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post(
      'https://api.telnyx.com/v2/calls',
      {
        to: '+1234567890',
        from: 'your_phone_number',
        connection_id: 'your_connection_id',
      },
      {
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'Bearer your_api_key',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
      }
    );
    console.log('Call initiated:', response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error.response.data);
  }
};

makeCall();
```

#### Python

```python theme={null}
import requests

url = "https://api.telnyx.com/v2/calls"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer your_api_key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
data = {
    "to": "+1234567890",
    "from": "your_phone_number",
    "connection_id": "your_connection_id",
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
print("Call initiated:", response.json())
```

### Understanding the Call Flow

When you make a call, here's what happens:

1. **Call Initiated**: Telnyx receives your API request and initiates the call.
2. **Webhook Sent**: Telnyx sends a `call.initiated` webhook to your URL.
3. **Call Progress**: Telnyx sends additional webhooks as the call progresses (`call.answered`, `call.hangup`, etc.).
4. **Your Response**: When the call is answered, you can use Voice API commands to control it (e.g., `speak`, enable `transcription`, start `recording`).
5. **Call End**: Final webhook (`call.hangup`) sent when the call completes.
